# ASmallHostel
 
Automation program for a boutique hotel.

Includes basic database controls (add, delete, update) and there is an admin panel with database connection. Also there is a section where you can add or delete admin in the database. I worked with three tables in which customers, rooms and authorizeds are registered.
